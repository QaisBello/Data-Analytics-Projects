## Overview
This project involves analyzing Adidas US sales data and creating an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel.

### Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel

### Steps
1. The first step is to clean the dataset.
2. Next, create pivot tables and a pivot chart.
3. Organize the pivot charts and all the visuals to create a single dashboard.
4. Finally, add slicers to make the dashboard interactive.

### Key Insights
### 1. Sales Growth Over Time (2020-2021):
- The total sales trend shows a steady increase from January 2020 to December 2021, with noticeable spikes in November and December of both years. This suggests strong sales during the holiday seasons, likely driven by promotions and consumer shopping behaviours.
  
### 2. Regional Sales Distribution:
- The sales distribution by state highlights strong performance in key states like California and Texas (darker blue regions on the map). The Southeast and West regions appear to be major markets for Adidas products in the US.

### 3. Sales by Retailer:
- Among retailers, West Gear is the top performer with sales reaching $242.96 million, followed by Foot Locker at $220.09 million and Sports Direct at $182.47 million.
Walmart and Amazon, typically large retailers, have lower sales compared to other retailers, with Walmart generating $74.56 million and Amazon $77.69 million.

### 4. Sales Method Breakdown:
- In-store sales account for the largest portion of total sales at 40%, followed by online sales at 33%, and outlet sales contributing the remaining 27%. This indicates a strong preference for physical shopping, though online sales are still significant and likely growing in importance.
  
### 5. Product Focus:
- While specific product breakdowns are not fully visible here, the presence of multiple categories (Men’s Apparel, Men’s and Women’s Athletic Footwear, Street Footwear, etc.) indicates a wide product offering. The balance in sales channels suggests that various products are performing well across different regions and retailers.
