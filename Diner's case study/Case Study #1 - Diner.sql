--------------------------------------Let's Start:-------------------------------------------

-- 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

-- Select the customer ID and the total amount each customer spent
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) as total_amount_each_customer_spent

-- Specify the tables we are retrieving data from and assign aliases
FROM sales as s
JOIN menu as m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id

-- Group the results by customer ID
GROUP BY s.customer_id;


-- 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

-- Select the customer ID and count of order dates for each customer
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_date) as total_amount_each_customer_spent
FROM sales

-- Group the results by customer ID
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

SELECT customer_id, order_date, first_item
FROM (
  -- This is the inner subquery where we perform the calculations
  SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date ASC) as row_num, -- Assigns a row number to each row within each customer group based on the order date
    order_date,
    m.product_name as first_item
  FROM sales as s
  JOIN menu as m
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
) subquery -- Alias for the subquery
WHERE row_num = 1; -- Selects only the rows with a row number of 1 (i.e., the first row within each customer group)

-- 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
SELECT TOP 1 m.product_name, COUNT(*) as purchase_count, s.product_id
FROM sales as s
JOIN menu as m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.product_id,m.product_name
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC;

-- 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

SELECT customer_id, product_name, product_id, total_orders
FROM (
    -- Subquery to calculate the total orders for each customer and product combination and assign row numbers
    SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, s.product_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
    FROM sales AS s
    JOIN menu AS m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name, s.product_id
) AS t
WHERE rn = 1 -- Filter the rows where the row number is 1 (most popular item for each customer)


-- 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

SELECT t.customer_id, t.first_purchase_date, m.product_name
FROM( select s.customer_id, MIN(s.order_date) as first_purchase_date
      from sales as s
	  JOIN menu as m
	  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	  JOIN members as mm
	  ON mm.customer_id= s.customer_id 
	  Where s.order_date > mm.join_date
	  GROUP BY s.customer_id
) as t
JOIN sales AS s ON t.customer_id = s.customer_id AND t.first_purchase_date = s.order_date
JOIN menu AS m ON s.product_id = m.product_id;

-- 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

SELECT customer_id, product_id, last_order, product_name
FROM (
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.product_id, MAX(s.order_date) AS last_order, product_name,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM sales AS s
    JOIN menu AS m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    JOIN members AS mm ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
    WHERE s.order_date < mm.join_date
    GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.product_id, product_name,order_date
) subquery
WHERE rn = 1;

-- 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(s.product_id) AS total_items, SUM(m.price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM sales AS s
JOIN members AS mm ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
JOIN menu AS m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < mm.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id;

-- 9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

SELECT s.customer_id,
	      SUM(CASE WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * m.price ELSE m.price END) * 10 AS total_points
FROM sales AS s
JOIN menu AS m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;


/*10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, 
not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?*/

SELECT
sales.customer_id,sum(CASE WHEN order_date <= DATEADD(DAY, 6, join_date) THEN menu.price * 2 ELSE menu.price END) AS total_points
FROM sales
JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2021 AND MONTH(order_date) = 1
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
